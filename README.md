# web-based-amms
A web-based Asset and Maintenance Management System (AMMS).

The web application is designed to use MySQL. However, other databases also can be used. The database configuration information is in the dbh-inc.php file.

Before running the application please import the SQL file which can be found in the SQL directory directly to the database (in case of MySQL).

In case you are using the information as imported from the SQL file:

For Manager's interface:
    Username = Dumbledore
    Password = 1234

For Worker's interface:
    Username = draco
    Password = 123
